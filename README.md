# Git, Docker, and Jenkins: A Guide

This repository provides an overview of **Git**, **Docker**, and **Jenkins**, essential tools for modern software development workflows. By leveraging these tools, developers can effectively manage source code, deploy applications, and automate software delivery processes.

---

## Git: Distributed Version Control System

**Git** is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time. It enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s work. Git allows you to manage your source code history, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if necessary. It is widely used in both open-source and commercial software development.

### Why Use Git?

- Track changes in your code.
- Collaborate seamlessly with team members.
- Revert to previous versions when needed.

### Basic Git Commands

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone an existing repository to your local machine.
- `git add <file>`: Add a file to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Commit the staged changes with a message.
- `git push`: Push your changes to the remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local repository.

---

## Docker: Containerization Platform

**Docker** is a platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers include everything needed to run an application, such as the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. This ensures consistent application behavior across environments.

### Why Use Docker?

- Create consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- Simplify deployment and improve scalability.
- Ideal for microservices architecture.

### Basic Docker Commands

- `docker build -t <image-name> .`: Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
- `docker run -p <host-port>:<container-port> <image-name>`: Run a container from an image and map ports.
- `docker ps`: List running containers.
- `docker stop <container-id>`: Stop a running container.
- `docker rm <container-id>`: Remove a stopped container.

---

## Jenkins: Automation Server

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server that helps automate parts of the software development process, including building, testing, and deploying applications. It is a key tool in Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines.

### Why Use Jenkins?

- Automate the build, test, and deployment process.
- Quickly catch issues with frequent code integration.
- Improve software quality and reliability.

### Basic Jenkins Concepts

- **Job/Project**: A task or a set of tasks that Jenkins executes.
- **Pipeline**: A series of automated steps to build, test, and deploy applications.
- **Build Trigger**: A mechanism to start a build, such as a code commit or a scheduled time.
- **Workspace**: The directory where Jenkins stores files related to a job.

Jenkins integrates seamlessly with tools like Git for version control and Docker for containerized builds.

---


By mastering **Git**, **Docker**, and **Jenkins**, you can create a robust and automated workflow for your software development projects. These tools work together to ensure your code is always in a deployable state, facilitating collaboration, deployment consistency, and continuous delivery.

# Python Web Application with CI/CD Using Jenkins and Docker

This project demonstrates how to build a simple Python web application using Flask, containerize it with Docker, and set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins. The source code is managed with Git, and the entire process is automated to ensure efficient and reliable deployments.

---

## Project Overview

We will:
1. Create a Python web application with Flask.
2. Containerize the application using Docker.
3. Set up a Jenkins pipeline to automate the build and deployment process.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Python** (Version 3.9 or later)
- **Docker**
- **Jenkins**
- **Git**

Additionally, basic knowledge of Python, Docker, and Jenkins is required.

---

## Step 1: Set Up the Python Web Application

1. Create a new directory for the project and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   mkdir python-docker-jenkins
   cd python-docker-jenkins
   
2. Initialize a Git repository:

```bash
  git init
```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  
```
# On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
- Open PowerShell as Administrator:

- Right-click on the PowerShell icon and select "Run as administrator".
- Set the Execution Policy:

- To allow the execution of scripts, you can temporarily set the execution policy to Bypass or RemoteSigned. The Bypass policy will allow all scripts to run without any restrictions, while the RemoteSigned policy requires that scripts downloaded from the internet be signed by a trusted publisher.

```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
```

- This command sets the execution policy for the current PowerShell session only.

- Activate the Virtual Environment:

- Now, try to activate the virtual environment again.


```PowerShell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

4. Install Flask:

```bash
  pip install Flask
```

5. Create a Flask application in a file named app.py:

```from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, Docker and Jenkins!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
```

- Create a file name called `requirements.txt` and enter ```Flask==2.0.2```

6. Test the application locally:

```bash
python app.py
```
Open ```http://localhost:5000``` in your browser to see the "Hello, Docker and Jenkins!" message.

## Step 2: Dockerize the Application

1. Create a Dockerfile in the project directory:

Dockerfile
```
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install flask

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

2. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t python-docker-jenkins .
```

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 python-docker-jenkins
```
Open ```http://localhost:5000``` to see the application running in the Docker container.

## Step 3: Set Up Jenkins for CI/CD

Install Jenkins from ```https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/windows/``` or pull the Jenkinsn image from docker and run on the specific port.


- Open Jenkins and create a new Freestyle Project.

- In the "Source Code Management" section, select Git and enter your repository URL:

```bash

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
```



Jenkins plays a crucial role in automating the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) processes for your project. Here's an explanation of Jenkins' role in this setup:

1. Role of Jenkins:
 Continuous Integration (CI):

Automating Builds: Jenkins automates the process of building your application. When you push changes to your GitHub repository, Jenkins can automatically detect these changes and trigger a new build. This ensures that your application is always up-to-date and that any errors introduced by new code are detected early.
Running Tests: Jenkins can run automated tests as part of the build process. This helps to ensure that your code changes do not introduce new bugs or break existing functionality.

 Continuous Deployment (CD):

Deploying Applications: Jenkins can automate the deployment of your application to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). In this project, Jenkins will build a Docker image of your Python application and run the Docker container, ensuring that your application is deployed consistently and reliably.
Pipeline Management: Jenkins allows you to define and manage complex deployment pipelines. You can specify multiple stages (e.g., build, test, deploy) and configure them to run sequentially or in parallel.
Integration with Version Control:

 Source Code Management: By integrating with GitHub, Jenkins can automatically fetch the latest code from your repository. This integration ensures that Jenkins always has access to the most recent version of your codebase.

 Build Triggers:

GitHub Hook Trigger: By enabling the "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling," you allow Jenkins to listen for webhooks from GitHub. This means that whenever you push changes to your repository, GitHub will notify Jenkins, and Jenkins will trigger a new build. This setup ensures that your CI/CD pipeline is automatically started whenever changes are made to the codebase.
