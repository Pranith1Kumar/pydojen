#What is Git and Why is Git Used?
#Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time. It enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s work. Git allows you to manage your source code history, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if necessary. It is widely used in both open-source and commercial software development.
